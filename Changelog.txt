    minecart tracks, pressure plates, half-height steps, doors, stairs,
    signs (though without the message), fences (though we make no effort
    to try and chain them together; all fence pieces will be oriented the
    same way), levers, buttons, portals.
  * Fixed an issue loading worlds which don't yet include the "Dimension" tag
