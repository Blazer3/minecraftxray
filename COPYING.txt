X-Ray itself is available under the New/Modified BSD License.  LWJGL is
also distributed under the same license, though specific details can be
found in COPYING-lwjgl.txt.  This distribution redistributes components
of launch4j, for Windows EXE generation, which is available under a BSD
license, and appears to include code under the MIT license, and includes
some binaries licensed under the GPL.  See COPYING-launch4j.txt for more
details on that.

In general the sourcecode files here will list a copyright for both Vincent
Vollers and CJ Kucera, though the actual distribution of code copyright
would probably be more complicated than that.  Please forgive any instances
of code misattribution!

They appear to be under a sort of generic public domain license.
