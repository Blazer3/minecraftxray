 * Load chunks on-demand (transparently, probably in another Thread) rather
   than all at once at the beginning.  Internally, this would probably mean
   storing chunks in a HashMap or something so that we could delete chunks
   that we don't need anymore, to keep memory usage down and actually support
   effectively infinitely-sized maps.  I'd have to look into how this would
   interact with X-Ray's minimap too.
   
 * Figure out transparency rendering glitches, and start using the
   transparent leaf texture for trees once that's been figured out.  Right
   now they look better with the solid texture.  In particular, all the
   "decorative" blocks like torches, flowers, reed, etc, look weird, as
   does water and portals.
   
 * Proper rendering support for redstone wire, minecart tracks, fences,
   and other blocks which change appearance depending on what's around
   them.  Minecart tracks should actually be quite easy since their
   orientation is actually stored in the Data values; the other ones
   will require some introspection.
 
 * Draw messages on signs like you'd expect.
 
 * Custom key bindings
 
 * Ensure "standard" resolutions are available in selection dialog.
 
 * Figure out creating an EXE for Windows folks (looks like probably this
   would just require getting JSmooth installed in a VM somewhere, or
   whatever...)
