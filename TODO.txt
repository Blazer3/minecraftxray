 * Figure out transparency rendering glitches, and start using the
   transparent leaf texture for trees once that's been figured out.  Right
   now they look better with the solid texture.  In particular, all the
   "decorative" blocks like torches, flowers, reed, etc, look weird, as
   does water and portals.
   
 * Proper rendering support for redstone wire, minecart tracks, fences,
   and other blocks which change appearance depending on what's around
   them.  Minecart tracks should actually be quite easy since their
   orientation is actually stored in the Data values; the other ones
   will require some introspection.
 
 * Draw messages on signs like you'd expect.
 
 * Custom key bindings
 
 * Highlighting for Reed/Sugarcane and other "special" block types
 
 * Highlighting for any arbitrary (user-chosen) block type
 
 * Find a way to eliminate the glitching when new map chunks are loading
   
 * Paintings
 
 * Home/End will wipe the minimap and load chunks, even if we're already
   "in range" and might even have those chunks cached.  Should fix that.
   
 * Minimap effective size has been cut quite a bit, would like to increase that
   
 * X-Ray should go into a "sleep" mode of sorts when it doesn't have focus,
   so that it can be run a bit more easily alongside Minecraft itself.
   
 * Figure out some kind of useful minimap when in the Nether
 
 * Would be nice to have a check when warping between Nether and Overworld
   to make sure you don't end up off-map
   
 * There are various conditions where the player position and spawn position
   markers won't show up properly on the minimap; should fix those.
   
 * "Explored Caverns" toggle, based on torch placement
